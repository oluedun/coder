TOPIC:                 Extracting Input in Java Program

DESCRIPTION:  I utilized the Scanner class to receive user or customer input. The Scanner class is in the java. util package. Customer is prompted to enter a name, after the name is entered, customer is prompted again to enter an age, age is entered, and another prompt can be utilized to retrieve more information. This can be a user-friendly program for any interface. Input can be of string or primitive types like int and double.

        int age;

        Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Please enter your name >> ");

        name = inputDevice.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Please enter your age >> ");
