TOPIC:                   Addition and Subtraction of Integers

 

DESCRIPTION:  I utilized the scanner class in java.util package to make addition and subtraction of integers from input after initializing the int primitive type as well as the sum and difference integers. Customer is prompted to enter an integer, integer is entered, another prompt is made for a second integer. Sum and Difference is calculated.

 

CODE:

            

  */

package arithmeticdemo;

 

/**

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticDemo {

 

    /**

     * @param args the command line arguments

     */

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int firstNumber;

        int secondNumber;

        int sum;

        int difference;

        int average;

        sum = 14 + 11;

        difference = 14 - 11;

       

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Please enter an integer >> ");

        firstNumber = input.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Please enter another integer >> ");

        secondNumber = input.nextInt();

        System.out.println(firstNumber + "+" + secondNumber + "is" + sum);

        System.out.println(firstNumber + "-" + secondNumber + "is" + difference);

}

 

OUTPUT:      ArithmeticDemo (run)

                        run:

                        Please enter an integer >> 14

                        Please enter another integer>>11

                        14+11is 25

                        14-11is 3

                        Build Successful!!
